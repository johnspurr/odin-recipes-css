# odin-recipes-css

This is a copy of [my original Recipes page project](https://github.com/johnspurr/odin-recipes) for [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic understanding of Git, HTML, and CSS. I will use the basic git workflow introduced earlier in the Foundations course and modify my original webpage to be a bit more aesthetically pleasing.
